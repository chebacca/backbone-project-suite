# BACKBONE v14.2 Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Firebase-First Web-Only Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every component must be designed for Firebase hosting and web-only deployment. No local development servers or Docker containers. All functionality must work in production Firebase environment with proper authentication, Firestore integration, and Firebase Functions.

### II. Mode Awareness System
Every feature must support both standalone desktop and collaborative network modes. Components must intelligently adapt based on current mode context without breaking existing functionality. Zero breaking changes when implementing mode awareness.

### III. Multi-Tenant Data Isolation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All data operations must enforce organization-based isolation. Every database query, API endpoint, and UI component must validate user organization membership. No cross-tenant data leakage allowed.

### IV. AI Integration Ready
All specifications must be designed for AI code generation. Use clear, structured descriptions that AI tools can understand and implement. Maintain consistency with existing AI integrations (Gemini API, etc.).

### V. Production-Ready Security
All features must implement proper Firebase Authentication, Firestore security rules, and input validation. No development shortcuts in production code. Security-first approach for all user data and API endpoints.

### VI. Shared MPC Library Compliance
All development must reference and follow the shared-mpc-library patterns. No duplication of existing patterns. Maintain consistency with established architecture and coding standards.

## Technology Stack Requirements

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript 5
- Vite 5 for build system
- Material-UI (MUI) for components
- Firebase SDK for authentication and data
- Mode-aware component architecture

### Backend
- Firebase Functions (Node.js 18+)
- Firestore for data storage
- Firebase Authentication
- Firebase Hosting for deployment
- No local servers or Docker containers

### Development Tools
- pnpm for package management
- Turbo for monorepo management
- ESLint and TypeScript for code quality
- Firebase emulators for local testing

## Security Standards

### Authentication
- Firebase Auth tokens required for all API calls
- Organization-based access control
- Role-based permissions (admin, member, viewer)
- Secure token validation and refresh

### Data Protection
- Firestore security rules for all collections
- Input validation and sanitization
- No sensitive data in client-side code
- Proper error handling without data exposure

## Performance Requirements

### Web Performance
- Fast initial load times (< 3 seconds)
- Efficient Firebase queries with proper indexing
- Optimized bundle sizes
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Real-time Features
- Efficient Firestore listeners
- Proper cleanup of subscriptions
- Optimistic updates where appropriate
- Minimal re-renders

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint compliance required
- Component testing for critical features
- Integration testing for Firebase functions

### Documentation
- All features must be documented in shared-mpc-library
- API endpoints must have clear specifications
- Component props and interfaces must be typed
- Deployment procedures must be documented

### Review Process
- All changes must be tested in Firebase emulators
- Production deployment requires successful build
- Security review for authentication changes
- Performance review for data-heavy features

## Governance

### Constitution Compliance
- All PRs must verify compliance with constitution
- Breaking changes require migration plan
- New features must follow established patterns
- Security violations are non-negotiable

### Amendment Process
- Constitution changes require team approval
- Breaking changes must be documented
- Migration plans required for major updates
- Version control for all constitution changes
