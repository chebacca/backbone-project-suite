/**
 * Fix Navigation Redirect Issues
 * 
 * This script addresses the issue with the NativeTitleBar icons not navigating properly
 * to their intended pages. The problem was caused by using React Router's navigate()
 * function with setTimeout, which was causing a race condition with the global redirect
 * in the application.
 * 
 * The fix replaces all navigate() calls in the NativeTitleBar component with direct
 * window.location.href navigation to ensure the browser properly loads the new URL
 * without being intercepted by React Router's history management.
 * 
 * Changes made:
 * 1. Replaced setTimeout + navigate() with direct window.location.href assignments
 * 2. Fixed navigation for all icon clicks, map icon, north star icon, and automation links
 * 3. Removed delays that were causing race conditions with redirects
 * 
 * This ensures that when a user clicks on an icon in the NativeTitleBar, they will
 * be taken directly to the corresponding page without unwanted redirects to the
 * sessions management page.

// This script is a documentation of the changes made to fix the navigation issue.
// The actual fixes were applied directly to the NativeTitleBar.tsx file.
